New.  I struggled with this, and ended up retyping quite a bit of this from an open source application, 
trying really hard not to do it word for word, but when it worked and mine didn't, given it's rice-paper fragility,
I chose functional over original.  I upgraded both reinstalling Eclipse and Java during this, lending a fair degree of frustration
to the process. I did end up copying a chunk of the Swing UI.  I do understand it better, but I don't feel adept with it yet.

I understand now how to use GUI components instead of variables, as well as how difficult it is to both build and work with.
I am hung up on some of the Swing things I don't yet understand, so by the end of the summer I hope to have this properly
converted to variables and have a new Swing UI, and possibly make it exensible enough to make a couple of different facades
to compare working with the different tools.
